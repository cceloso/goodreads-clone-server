# Goodreads Clone Mini App (Server-side)

This is the repository for the server-side of a full-stack application inspired by Goodreads. The app was done during the Saperium Internship Program 2021 and was built using Angular for the front-end, nodeJS for the back-end, mySQL and Redis for the data stores, and socket.IO for real-time web. In the app, users can add books, write reviews and comments, and discuss books and other topics in forums.
